# api-assignment

Below are the instructions of the api assignment:

* You are tasked with developing and designing a small application of any kind that incorporates the use of APIs.
* You can edit and use the website that you develop in Front-End Web development (As a bonus).
* The focus of this assignment is on how you will use external APIs to fetch and display relevant data in your app.
* It is important to read the documentation of each APIs you will use (e.g. endpoints, how to access APIs keys, etc.)
* You are expected to refer to the following external APIs in developing the web application:
https://rapidapi.com/categoriesLinks to an external site.
* Or any sources you prefer (Careful to vet the public APIs you use as some might be malicious)
* You will focus on using external APIs (e.g. APIs for travel, entertainment, etc.) and extending the functionality of your application by making use of a public API of your choice
* The application you come up with should be useful and not gimmicky (i.e. focus should be on functionality, not bells and whistles like crazy and over the top UI. A CLI app is also acceptable) 
* You should also display the data in an easy to use and understand format (e.g. statistical data, etc.) and let the user interact with the data you provided (e.g. sort, etc.)
* Along with your Github link to the app you make, upload a small demo of a 2 min video showing us how to use your app

## The Kenyanews CLI App

* Use **node kenya-entertainment.js** to run the code

## Install Dependancies

* Install **npm install -g npm** for you to be able to use the node function and fetch module
* Sign up for an api key on https://newsapi.org/ incase the api key i used might have expired
